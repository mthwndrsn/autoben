# Automation Benefit Calculator

Welcome to the Automation Benefit Calculator! This simple web app helps you calculate the potential time and cost savings from automating a manual and repetitive process. Hosted on GitHub Pages, this tool can be easily accessed and used directly from your browser.

## Features

   - Frequency of the process (times per month).
   - Time spent on the automated process (hours per instance).
   - Hourly cost rate ($).

2. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to compute the time saved and potential cost savings.

3. **Results**: View the results, including total manual time, total automated time, time saved, and potential cost savings per month.
